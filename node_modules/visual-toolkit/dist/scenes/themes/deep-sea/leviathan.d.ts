/**
 * Leviathan Scene
 *
 * Encounter with a massive, ancient creature revealed by light.
 * The leviathan's eye reacts to cursor position (ROV light). The creature
 * reveals detail only when illuminated - a second eye, surface scarring,
 * and bonus bioluminescent spots appear as you shine light on it.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Eye tracking that responds to light proximity
 * - Pupil dilation (round) and contraction (slit) based on illumination
 * - Light-responsive body details (scarring, secondary eye)
 * - Bioluminescent spots that increase with illumination
 * - Small seeker creatures attracted to the light
 * - Atmospheric cursor-based light beam
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```typescript
 * const scene = scenes.deepSea.leviathan;
 * await scene.init(canvas, { intensity: 0.8, duration: Infinity });
 * // ... later ...
 * scene.cleanup();
 * ```
