/**
 * Seekers Scene - Bioluminescent seekers attracted to light
 *
 * A dynamic scene featuring a swarm of small bioluminescent creatures
 * that are drawn to light sources (like the ROV cursor). The seekers
 * exhibit realistic behavior: attraction to light, timidity (flee if
 * light moves too fast), and complex swarming dynamics.
 *
 * Features:
 * - 50 individual seeker creatures with unique properties
 * - Light-seeking behavior with realistic physics
 * - Flee behavior when threatened (light moves too fast)
 * - Orbital nervous behavior when too close to light
 * - Wandering behavior in darkness
 * - Bioluminescent glow that pulses with intensity
 * - Marine snow particle system for atmosphere
 * - Vignette edge darkening
