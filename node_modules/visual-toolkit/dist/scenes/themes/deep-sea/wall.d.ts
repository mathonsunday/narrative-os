/**
 * Wall Scene
 *
 * Encounter with a massive organic surface covered in watching eyes.
 * The wall is generated using simplex noise and Bezier curves to create
 * an organic, living appearance. Eyes track the cursor (ROV light),
 * opening when illuminated and closing in darkness.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Organic surface with simplex noise for texture
 * - Bezier curve "veins" with variable thickness
 * - Light-responsive subsurface scattering
 * - 12 eyes scattered across surface
 * - Eye tracking: Pupils follow cursor position
 * - Illumination response: Eyes brighten and dilate when lit
 * - Pupil morphing: Round in darkness, slit when illuminated
 * - Blinking animation with random timing
 * - Sparse particle system
 * - Multi-layer spotlight effect
 * - Heavy vignette for atmospheric depth
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```typescript
 * const scene = scenes.deepSea.wall;
 * await scene.init(canvas, { intensity: 0.8, duration: Infinity });
 * // ... later ...
 * scene.cleanup();
 * ```
